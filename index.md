AAA HOW DID U FIND THIS WORK IN PROGRESS 

Hi! Iâ€™m Julie Steele, a sophomore at MIT studying computer science, artificial intelligence, and econ. My current research interests are in machine learning, probablistic programming, and program synthesis. I'm passionate about mitigating risks that will come with AI. I also love math problems, dancing, improv comedy, and meeting new people.

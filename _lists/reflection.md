## Reflection on Classes

### Freshman spring

- **18.06**: I love linear algebra as a topic, but this class doesn't have interesting problems or go deep enough into topics.
- **6.120**: Great class! Cool problems. Worth skipping if a lot of competition math experience.
- **14.01**: Fascinating game theory topics. Loved the content. Unorganized class structure.
- **6.101**: SO GOOD! Weekly difficult well-made interesting programming labs. Good access to office hours help, difficult yet approachable.
- **8.02**: Decent!

### Freshman fall

- **18.022**: WONDERFUL proof based lectures from Borodin, small interactive class, boring homework. Take over 18.02.
- **14.73**: LIFE CHANGING. About being scientific about poverty interventions. Nobel prize-winning teacher does random controlled trial experiments on stuff like vaccine ads vs free food at vaccine centers, different types of insurance, etc. Interactive discussions and presentations. Ask me about this class.
- **6.100A**: Skip to 6.101 if you have programming experience. Will be hard if you have 0 programming experience.
- **6.100B**: Interesting grab bag of data science topics.
- **8.01**: Interactive, alright! Wish I ASEd but solid.
- **1.008**: Boring.
- **15.A04**: Little content, met some people in the trust center.

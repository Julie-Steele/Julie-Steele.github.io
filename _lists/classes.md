## Reflection on Classes

### Sophomore fall  
- **Deep Learning 6.s898**: FANTASTIC! current deep learning architectures. Homework a good mix of theory and PyTorch, definitely need to work with others. Great lectures from Beery and Isola, learned a ton. I ended up using all of what I learned content and coding wise. 
- **Abstract Algebra I 18.701**: HARD GOOD problems in the homework, which I mostly could get after puzzling over or office hours. I'm really really proud of my progress with this class since I didn't find it easy. I met my match though because this class was tough. Half of the class got perfect scores on every difficult quiz which I couldn't have dreamed of getting. I found lectures too hard too follow and there to be a lack of resources for the class. I worked hard and enjoyed it. 
- **Algorithms 6.121**: The tests were fun with thinking of algorithms during the time and all! I did this class somewhat minimally skipping lecture and then using lecture notes and figuring stuff out as needed which was rough at times. I think well made material/lecture notes but also idk all the large lectures are outdated. 
- **National Security 17.46**: LOVED super relevant content taught by a really approachable, engaging professor. Learned about relevant topics like 9/11, nuclear weapons, sanctions, and tons more. Ended up writing final essay proposing international AI regulation as well. Really recommend taking this Lin-Greenberg class. 

### Freshman spring

- **Linear Algebra 18.06**: I love linear algebra as a topic, but this class doesn't have interesting problems or go deep enough into topics.
- **Discrete Math 6.120**: Great class! Cool problems. Worth skipping if a lot of competition math experience.
- **Micro Econ 14.01**: Fascinating game theory topics. Loved the content. Unorganized class structure.
- **Fundamentals of Programming 6.101**: SO GOOD! Weekly difficult well-made interesting programming labs. Good access to office hours help, difficult yet approachable.
- **Electricity & Magnetism 8.02**: Decent!

### Freshman fall

- **Advanced Multivariable 18.022**: WONDERFUL proof based lectures from Borodin, small interactive class, boring homework. Take over 18.02.
- **World Poverty 14.73**: LIFE CHANGING. About being scientific about poverty interventions. Nobel prize-winning teacher does random controlled trial experiments on stuff like vaccine ads vs free food at vaccine centers, different types of insurance, etc. Interactive discussions and presentations. Ask me about this class.
- **Intro to Python 6.100A**: Skip to 6.101 if you have programming experience. Will be hard if you have 0 programming experience.
- **Intro to Data Science 6.100B**: Interesting grab bag of data science topics.
- **Mechanics 8.01**: Interactive, alright! Wish I ASEd but solid.
- **Environmental Engineering Seminar 1.008**: Sadly just really boring. 
- **Entrepreneurship Seminar 15.A04**: Little content, met some people in the trust center.

Ended up fulling time tracking all homework this semester, so have that data

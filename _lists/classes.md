## Reflection on Classes

### Sophomore fall  (in progress)
- **Deep Learning 6.s898**
- **Abstract Algebra I 18.701** 
- **Algorithms 6.121**
- **National Security 17.46**

### Freshman spring

- **Linear Algebra 18.06**: I love linear algebra as a topic, but this class doesn't have interesting problems or go deep enough into topics.
- **Discrete Math 6.120**: Great class! Cool problems. Worth skipping if a lot of competition math experience.
- **Micro Econ 14.01**: Fascinating game theory topics. Loved the content. Unorganized class structure.
- **Fundamentals of Programming 6.101**: SO GOOD! Weekly difficult well-made interesting programming labs. Good access to office hours help, difficult yet approachable.
- **Electricity & Magnetism 8.02**: Decent!

### Freshman fall

- **Advanced Multivariable 18.022**: WONDERFUL proof based lectures from Borodin, small interactive class, boring homework. Take over 18.02.
- **World Poverty 14.73**: LIFE CHANGING. About being scientific about poverty interventions. Nobel prize-winning teacher does random controlled trial experiments on stuff like vaccine ads vs free food at vaccine centers, different types of insurance, etc. Interactive discussions and presentations. Ask me about this class.
- **Intro to Python 6.100A**: Skip to 6.101 if you have programming experience. Will be hard if you have 0 programming experience.
- **Intro to Data Science 6.100B**: Interesting grab bag of data science topics.
- **Mechanics 8.01**: Interactive, alright! Wish I ASEd but solid.
- **Environmental Engineering Seminar 1.008**: Sadly just really boring. 
- **Entrepreneurship Seminar 15.A04**: Little content, met some people in the trust center.

Ended up fulling time tracking all homework this semester, so have that data

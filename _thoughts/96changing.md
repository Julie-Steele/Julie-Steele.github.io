# Changing Opinions 

Who even are we if our opinions change so easily depending on the circumstance? 

Little example for me: when I'm in D.C I want kids more than I do when I think about it while in Cambridge. 

I'm also talking about cognative biases: 
- Anchoring (feeling like paying a little less than an unreasonably high anchor is a deal)
- Conformity (group normas)

Or like that toddler thing you can do where you give someone two bad options and they suddenly stop minding to do the thing. 

AAAaa what does anyone think anymore if it can be primed so many ways.

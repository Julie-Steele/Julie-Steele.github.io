# Diary Projections
- Life is 3D (actually more). My diary, camera roll, and this website are projections onto 2D (actually more)
- I could rotate my life and project it differently
- Each medium is a different type of scanner (x-ray, interview, etc) that can't fully capture
- The direction I choose to project it is information in itself
- I'm scared I'll mess this up with this website

- I reread my COVID diaries, and often even if I didn't list what I did that day, reading my thoughts and desires was as informative. That's like instead of seeing a shape(the tree), seeing the leaves.

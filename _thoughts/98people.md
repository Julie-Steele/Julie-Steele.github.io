# Helping People

I love people and want to make them happy. There's **so** many more people around the world doing far worse than the people local to me who I can help much more efficiently (theres almost a billion on <$2 / day. Internalize this! thats in PPP, so already adjusting for living cost). In addition to that, there's **even so** many more people who could live in the future, unless we mess up the planet or dangerous technology, which it is looking like we are about to ruin.   

If that isn't reason to do something about it right now, I don't know what is.

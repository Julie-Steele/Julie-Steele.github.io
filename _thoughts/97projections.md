# Diary Projections: LifeMath Part 2
- Life is 3D (actually more). My diary, camera roll, and this website are projections onto 2D (actually more)
- I could rotate my life and project it differently
- Each medium is a different type of scanner (x-ray, interview, etc) that can't fully capture
- The direction I choose to project it is information in itself
- I'm scared I'll mess this up with this website, coming off too self centered since the website is about myself
### More
- One week over the summer [I experimented with having no evidence of that week](https://julie-steele.github.io/goals-and-challenges) (there is still no evidence of the week, and I haven't told anyone what happened) to see if it would change my spontaneity, drive for learning, etc. 
- I enjoy taking these projections: both to better feel the moment and for evidence later. 
- I reread my COVID diaries a bit ago. Often even if I didn't list what I did that day, reading my thoughts and desires was as informative. That's like instead of seeing a shape(the tree), seeing the leaves.
- Many come to the conclusion that because websites, social medias, etc are just projections and don't show the full person, they should not have them. I think a badly taken x-ray is more informative than none.

# Life is Optimal for the Proposers

![Thoughts Image](../_imgs/stablemarriage.png)

## Stable Marriage Problem

- **Objective**: Match two sets of elements (e.g., men and women) into pairs.
- **Preferences**: Each element ranks the opposite set in order of preference.
- **Stable Match**: 
  - A pair is stable if no two elements prefer each other over their current partners.
- **A Solution Method (Gale-Shapley Algorithm)**:
  - One group (e.g., men) proposes to their top choice.
  - The other group (e.g., women) accepts or rejects proposals.
  - Rejected elements propose to their next choice.
  - Repeat above until all elements are paired.

  Turns out, this is OPTIMAL for the proposers and PESSIMAL for the evaluators.
